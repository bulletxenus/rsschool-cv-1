#### Briefly about myself

Having started my career as a layout designer  with any skills, I became a doctor.
But one day I desided to try learning  frontend...

Two months ago I’ve become passionate about retouching. I’ve mastered different retouching techniques,
learned to work with graphic tablet.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
